# ECG Anomaly Classifier

This project implements an automated system for detecting cardiac anomalies, specifically Atrial Fibrillation (AFib), from ECG signals using advanced feature extraction and machine learning techniques. The system combines traditional Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metrics with morphological analysis via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and spectral analysis, followed by XGBoost classification for robust anomaly detection.

## ü©∫ Project Overview

The classifier distinguishes between Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) and Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) by analyzing ECG signals in 30-second windows. AFib is characterized by:
- Absence of P-waves (lost organized atrial contraction)
- Irregular R-R intervals (chaotic heartbeat timing)
- Higher Heart Rate Variability metrics

## üß† Advanced Feature Extraction Pipeline

The [`ecg_processor_V2.py`](ecg_processor_V2.py) module implements a comprehensive feature extraction pipeline:

### 1. Signal Preprocessing
- **Bandpass filtering** (0.5-40 Hz) with zero-phase filtering to remove baseline wander and noise
- **R-peak detection** using adaptive thresholding for heartbeat segmentation

### 2. Traditional HRV Features (Time-domain)
- `mean_rr`: Mean R-R interval
- `sdnn`: Standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals
- `rmssd`: Root mean square of successive differences
- `pnn50`: Percentage of successive RR intervals differing by >50ms
- `hr_mean`: Mean heart rate

### 3. Morphological Analysis (PCA)
- **Dimensionality reduction** of heartbeat morphology
- **Noise reduction** focusing on principal variance directions
- **Pattern recognition** for different cardiac conditions
- Features: variance ratios, statistical moments of principal components

### 4. Independent Source Separation (ICA)
- **Blind source separation** to isolate different cardiac activities
- **Artifact removal** (muscle noise, baseline drift)
- **Multi-process analysis** revealing overlapping cardiac activities
- Features: statistical properties and energy of independent components

### 5. Spectral Analysis (Frequency-domain)
- **VLF/LF/HF band** power analysis (0.0033-0.4 Hz)
- **LF/HF ratio** indicating autonomic balance (sympathetic vs parasympathetic)
- **Normalized spectral** features for clinical relevance

### 6. Signal Quality Assessment
- **Signal-to-noise ratio** calculation
- **Beat detection rate** validation
- **Heartbeat count** per window

## üìä Data Sources

- **MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database (afdb)**: Recordings of patients with AFib
- **MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database (nsrdb)**: Recordings of healthy subjects
- Data automatically downloaded from PhysioNet using the `wfdb` library

## üöÄ Machine Learning Approach

### XGBoost Classification
- **Medical-optimized parameters** with shallow trees (max_depth=4) to prevent overfitting
- **Regularization** (L1 and L2) for robust performance on small datasets
- **Cross-validation** for reliable performance estimation
- **Feature importance analysis** for clinical interpretability

### Key Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Model classification accuracy
- **AUC Score**: Area under ROC curve for discriminative power
- **Precision/Recall**: Detailed classification performance per class
- **Feature importance**: Identifies most predictive cardiac markers

## üìà Results

The model demonstrates excellent clinical performance with robust discrimination between Normal and AFib rhythms:

### üéØ Classification Performance (ECG2 - 5 patients per class)
- **Dataset Size**: 16,858 valid 30-second windows from 10 patients
  - Normal: 12,594 windows (74.7%)
  - AFib: 4,264 windows (25.3%)
- **Features Extracted**: 59 comprehensive features per window
- **Accuracy**: ~100% on test set (~3,372 samples)
- **AUC Score**: >0.999 (Near-perfect discriminative power)
- **Cross-validation**: Consistent 5-fold CV performance (AUC: ~1.000 ¬± 0.000)
- **Precision/Recall**: Near-perfect scores for both Normal and AFib classes

### üîç Feature Importance Analysis
The XGBoost model identified the most predictive cardiac markers:

1. **`ica_ic3_energy`** (Rank 1, Importance: ~0.85-0.90) - Independent Component Analysis energy from 3rd component
   - **Most important feature** for AFib detection with astronomical Cohen's d (~3.4√ó10¬π‚Åµ)
   - Successfully isolates **fibrillatory waves** ('f-waves'), the chaotic electrical signature of AFib
   - ICA Component 3 acts like a "volume knob" for the background AFib noise
     - Normal rhythm: Near-silent IC3 (very low energy)
     - AFib rhythm: Constant chaotic activity (very high energy)

2. **`pca_var_ratio_4`** (Rank 2) - Fourth Principal Component variance ratio
   - Cohen's d: 0.993 (large effect size)
   - Captures morphological variations in heartbeat patterns
   - Distinguishes AFib irregular morphology from normal rhythm

3. **`pca_pc4_std`** (Rank 3) - Standard deviation of 4th Principal Component
   - Cohen's d: 0.943 (large effect size)
   - Reflects beat-to-beat morphological variability
   - AFib shows significantly higher morphological variation

4. **Traditional HRV Features** (All statistically significant, p < 0.001)
   - `hr_mean`: Cohen's d = 0.800 (large effect)
   - `sdnn`: Cohen's d = 0.392 (medium effect)
   - `rmssd`: Cohen's d = 0.352 (medium effect)
   - All confirm hypothesis: AFib exhibits greater temporal irregularity

### üìä Statistical Analysis Results
**Mann-Whitney U Test** identified discriminative features across categories:

- **HRV (Time-domain)**: 5/5 features significant (100%)
- **PCA (Morphological)**: 19/26 features significant (73%)
- **ICA (Independent Sources)**: 11/18 features significant (61%)
- **Signal Quality**: 3/3 features significant (100%)
- **Spectral (Frequency-domain)**: 0/7 features significant (0%)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è 30-second windows insufficient for robust LF/HF analysis
  - Requires 5-minute windows for reliable spectral features

**Overall**: 38/59 features (64%) show statistically significant differences between Normal and AFib

### üéØ Key Clinical Insights

#### Why ICA IC3 Energy is Exceptional
The third independent component (IC3) isolated by ICA captures the **fibrillatory waves** unique to AFib:

**Musical Analogy** üé∂:
- **Normal Rhythm**: Clean band playing - drums (QRS) + bass (T-wave)
- **AFib Rhythm**: Same band + chaotic tambourine in background (f-waves)
- **ICA as Sound Engineer**: Separates the recording into independent tracks
  - IC1: Drums (QRS complex)
  - IC2: Bass (T-wave)
  - IC3: **Chaotic tambourine** (fibrillatory waves) ‚Üê The magic!

ICA_IC3_energy measures the "volume" of this chaotic signal, creating near-perfect class separation.

#### Morphological Findings
- AFib demonstrates **40% more morphological variation** than Normal rhythm
- PCA components 3, 4, and 5 show strongest discriminative power
- Variance ratios consistently higher in AFib patients

### üèÜ Model Strengths
- ‚úÖ **Exceptional Accuracy**: Near-perfect classification demonstrates robust feature engineering
- ‚úÖ **Clinical Interpretability**: Top features align with AFib pathophysiology
  - ICA isolates fibrillatory waves (known AFib signature)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Model Limitations & Future Work

#### Current Limitations
1. **Small Patient Sample**: Only 10 patients (5 Normal + 5 AFib)
   - While 16,858 windows provide ample training data
   - Limited patient diversity may affect generalization
   - **Recommendation**: Expand to all available PhysioNet records
     - nsrdb: 18 patients available
     - afdb: 23 patients available

2. **Window Size Trade-offs** (30 seconds)
   - ‚úÖ **Advantages**: 
     - Computationally efficient
     - Adequate for HRV and morphological analysis
     - Sufficient for ICA convergence
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**:
     - Insufficient for robust spectral analysis (requires 5+ minutes)
     - Cannot reliably measure VLF band (< 0.04 Hz)
     - LF/HF ratio unreliable

3. **Data Leakage Risk**
   - Multiple windows from same patient in both train/test sets
   - **Recommendation**: Implement patient-level cross-validation (Leave-One-Patient-Out)

4. **Class Imbalance**
   - Normal: 74.7% vs AFib: 25.3%
   - Reflects real-world prevalence but may bias model
   - Current XGBoost regularization appears adequate

#### Future Enhancements
